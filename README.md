### Third Project:

In this assignment, you are going to loop over an array of names and print out either a hello or goodbye to that name to the browser console. If the name starts with a letter j or J, you are to print out Goodbye JSomeName. If the name starts with any other letter, you are to print out Hello SomeName.
